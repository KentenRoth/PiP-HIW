						<p>In the HTML file, there are two buttons and a hidden video player.  One button will open the list of open tabs you have, and the other one will activate picture in picture.  Using the navigator API, we can use built-in functions to grab the display media.  Once we get the media we want to play, we need to pass that into the video element.  Once we have the video source, we then run the 'onloadmetadata' function to start playing the video.  Now that the first part is finished, we can get the picture in picture activated.  For activating picture in picture, all that is needed is to use the HTLMVideoElement API and use the 'requestPictureInPicture' function.  This promise will resolve into a picture in picture window, allowing you to resize, relocate, and keep the window above open windows. </p>

							<h3>Coding Tutorials</h3>
							<p>I have used this several times while following along with coding tutorials.  Before, I would either shrink down my editor and the video or always look between screens.  Using picture in picture I can keep the tutorial floating above the editor as I follow along.</p>

							<h3>Keep up with the game</h3>
							<p>I enjoy watching baseball and other sports while I code.  Using picture in picture I can keep the game open while I code and continue to get work done.  No longer does my game get knocked behind the screen, and I miss a big play.</p>

							<h3>Watch Streams</h3>
							<p>Sometimes there is a good stream on while I am playing games.  I enjoy playing chess, but when there is a large chess tournament being streamed, I want to watch while I play.  Picture in picture keeps the stream above my open window to allow me to play and watch.</p>

						<p>The main take away from this project is that something might sound complicated, but most likely, there is already an easy solution if you look for it.  So when it came to this project, I thought it would be a lot of code and be too complicated.  I spent some time on google, looking at articles, and watched a couple of videos, and realized that this project didn't have a lot to it.  Since building this project, I have looked more into what you can do with the navigator API.  I found some interesting properties and methods you can use with navigator.  I don't have any projects in mind that I would use these, but to know what is there and to know what I could use is always helpful.  </p>
